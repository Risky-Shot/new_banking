# [ESX] NEW_BANKING Script for FiveM

Hey! This is reworked new_banking with following changes :

> * Optimized (0.01ms to 0.05ms) <br>
> * No more deposits at ATM (player need to visit bank to deposit cash) <br>
> * Cannot access ATM/Bank while being in a vehicle <br>
> * Includes **/givecash id amount** to nearby player <br>
> * Added animation before UI opens  <br>
> * Working ATM Objects (Using RayCast System) but still if any ATM is bugged it can be added in ATM list <br>
> * Character Name shows on Balance Page (need esx_identity or anything else which adds firstname and lastname in mysql users table) <br>
> * Use RegisterKeyMapping Instead of Checking IsJustKeyPressed, which means button to access Bank/ATM can be customised in Keybinds -> FiveM <br>
> * Command to access bank/ATM -> **/banking** <br>
> * Added Event for Bank Robbery scripts which can be used to Disable Banking Facility during robberies <br>
> * CSS redesign (maybe because I was using it in my old server so not sure if my other dev did that or we found that on github) <br>
> * Fixed CSS (alignmnet and stuff by Ashu) <br>
